- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know? The term "bug" in software development actually has its origins in a real insect! In 1947,
     computer scientist Grace Hopper and her team found a moth causing a malfunction in the Mark II computer at Harvard University.
     They recorded the incident as the "first actual case of bug being found" and the term stuck around ever since.
     Nowadays, debugging has become a crucial part of coding!
